This plugin will produce output for your gradle project similar to:

	:versions

	Dependency                                             Using              Update
	----------                                             -----              ------
	com.github.nwillc:almost-functional                    1.6.+ ->            1.7.7
	junit:junit                                             4.11
	org.assertj:assertj-core                               1.7.0
	com.h2database:h2                                    1.4.182
	com.github.nwillc:contracts                            1.6.2
